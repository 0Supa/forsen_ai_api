# BAJ AI

## Funny character AI using twitch reward buttons with:
- Control panel that allows you to skip unwanted requests.
- Custom characters with custom personalities and custom voices. (you can create your AI persona)
- Uncensored LLM. (no more "as an AI language model I hate white color")
- Word filter List. You can filter words you don't want to listen or see, both from the chatter requested and from the AI responding.
- Forsen forsen forsen forsen forsen forsen forsen forsen forsen forsen.

## Plans:
- [ ] Use postgres instead of sqlite
- [ ] Use go interpreter instead of lua scripts
- [ ] Add AI hub where users can push their custom characters
- [ ] Switch TTS to metavoice when it's ready
- [ ] Better config - max response/request duration, enable/disable AI memory
